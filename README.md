## Vanilla Rest API

This program contains a body parser module that uses promises to parse the JSON body POST and PUT requests. It also contains a router that handles all requests for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. It also contains a storage module that stores "paintings" by their title and content. Each resource is given a unique id provided by the UUID package.
